This project contains the files required to make my first blog website.
For the backend part I have used FLASK and for the frontend part I have used HTML, CSS and my favourite Bootstrap.
For the database part I have used phpMyAdmin
In the app.py file flask program is written
In the template folder , all the html and json files are stored
In the static folder , all the images and css files are stored
